### Unit 2

# Animation on SenseHAT

### with Loops and Functions

In this unit, the students dig deeper into Python programming by learning to control individual pixels of the LED matrix on the SenseHAT. They will learn how to design both static and animated pictures and implement them on the LED matrix. In this process, they will learn more flow control techniques such as loops and conditionals. They will also learn to decompose problems, and build abstractions with custom functions.  The final product of this unit is a MicroProject of an animation on the LED matrix.
