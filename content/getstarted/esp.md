The ESP8266 microcontroller board comes with an Arduino-compatible firmware that allows you to program it with the Arduino IDE.  However, in order to program with with MicroPython, we will need to flash the MicroPython firmware.

#### Flashing the MicroPython firmware

Please follow this [official
guide](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html#getting-the-firmware)
on how to flash the MicroPython firmware.

#### Programming the ESP8266 board with an IDE

The ESP8266 board can be programmed with any computer, including a
Raspberry Pi. There are multiple IDEs available for different platforms.
We recommend that you use Windows computers to program the ESP8266
boards, because there are two great IDEs available on Windows:

- [uPyCraft IDE](https://github.com/DFRobot/uPyCraft/blob/master/uPyCraft_V0.24.exe?raw=true)
- [EsPy IDE](https://github.com/jungervin/EsPy/blob/master/EsPy/Release/EsPy.1.0.0.7.7z?raw=true)

[ESPlorer](https://esp8266.ru/esplorer/) is also an excellent IDE available **for all platforms**.
