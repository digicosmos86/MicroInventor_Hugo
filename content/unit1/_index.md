### Unit 1

# Introduction to Python 

### with Raspberry Pi and SenseHAT

The focus of this first unit is to familiarize students with basic skills of programming in Python 3, a high-level programming language that is beginner-friendly. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of text-based programming, and use them to control the sensors and LED matrix on the SenseHAT. The micro-project for this unit is a short Python code that reads data from temperature/humidity sensors, converts the Celsius temperature into Fahrenheit, and display the temperature/humidity information creatively on the LED matrix, based on sensor readings. This micro-project lays the foundation for the next one, which sends sensor readings to other devices.
