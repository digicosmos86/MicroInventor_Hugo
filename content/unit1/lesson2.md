## Lesson Information

This lesson introduces students to the Raspberry Pi microcomputer. The
goal of the lesson is to familiarize students to their development
environment based on Linux. By the end of the class they will have solid
understanding of the differences between software and hardware, and will
be able to name a few important types of hardware/software as well as a
few examples in each category.

## Instructional Plan and Structure

### Overview of the lesson (5 minutes)

Communicate to the students that we are going to do 3 things today: 1)
learn what a Raspberry Pi computer is, 2) get a Raspberry Pi computer to
work, and 3) start programming with the Raspberry Pi.

Ask the students what they think a computer might look like and what
some of the vital parts are. Then introduce to the students the
Raspberry Pi. Highlight the fact that it is **small** (the size of a
credit card), **inexpensive** (costs only $35, so everyone can buy
one), and incredibly **powerful** and fun to play with. And now we are
going to learn what it is and how it works.

### Raspberry Pi Unplugged (15 minutes)

Hand out to the students the barebone Raspberry Pis (Those not in cases,
or take the Raspberry Pis out of the cases). Ask the students to discuss
what they think each parts are. A print-out of the image below might be
very helpful:

### Getting the Raspberry Pi to Work (15 minutes)

Now ask the students to assemble the Raspberry Pis. Introduce the cables
and port names would be helpful. Those are:

* HDMI port on Raspberry Pi -\> DVI port on monitor (secure the DVI port with the screws
* MicroUSB port on Raspberry Pi -\> AC Power
* Power cable on monitor -\> AC Power
* USB ports on Raspberry Pi - Keyboard and mouse

### Raspbian - the Software (15 minutes)

Now that the students Raspberry Pis are up and running, go through the
software systems of Raspberry Pi.

* The **operating system (OS)** of the Raspberry Pi is a version of
    Linux (No need to know Raspbian but Linux is important). What are
    the differences between Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and Linux
    OSes?
* Go through some of the software. Raspberry Pi is designed for kids
    to learn coding, so there are plenty of IDEs. There is a free
    version of office on Raspberry Pis as well (LibreOffice), and there
    are also games (Minecraft) and web-browsers (Chromium, a free
    version of Google Chrome).
* A very important software is called the **terminal** (which can be
    launched on the task bar). Open the taskbar and remind the students
    what computers were like before there were Graphical User Interfaces
    (GUI).

### Get started with Python (5 minutes)

This part serves as a hook to next class's activities. The students can
start programming in Python in two ways:

* Type `python3` in the terminal
* Start **Thonny Python** found in the start menu

This starts an **interactive programming environment** (also called
`REPL`) of Python, indicated by the three arrows `>>>`. The students can
feel free to type whatever they like.
